# Over View of Project
## Goal of Project	
To use the CoinGecko API to pull in different types of data related to the criptto curency. Along with pulling in basic market data, I will also be pulling in a full list of all coins that are in Coingecko and have a person pass a filter critera to make the list of coins much shorter.

## API Information
----------------
The API that is used is the free API that is provided by CoinGecko. All of documentation can be found at [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation). Here is the link to the Github repo that made the API work more seemlessly in python [python coingecko API repo](https://github.com/man-c/pycoingecko).
